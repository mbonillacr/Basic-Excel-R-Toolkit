# Next Steps

## Story Manager Handoff
The Story Manager should begin implementation with Story 1.1 (Infrastructure Foundation and CI/CD Pipeline) as it establishes the foundation for all subsequent development. Key integration requirements validated:
- Existing BERT v2.4.3 build process must remain functional during transition
- All current functionality must be preserved through comprehensive regression testing
- Performance benchmarks must meet or exceed current system capabilities

Critical constraints from actual project analysis:
- Windows COM interface dependencies require careful handling during modernization
- Legacy language versions (R 3.4.x, Julia 0.6.2) need compatibility layers
- File-based configuration migration must be seamless and reversible

First story implementation should focus on establishing CI/CD pipeline while maintaining existing Visual Studio build capability for smooth transition.

## Developer Handoff
Developers beginning implementation should reference this architecture document alongside existing coding patterns identified in the codebase analysis. Integration requirements validated with user include:
- Preservation of existing C++ COM interface patterns for Excel Add-in compatibility
- Maintenance of existing TypeScript Console workflows and keyboard shortcuts
- Backward compatibility for all existing user-defined R and Julia functions

Key technical decisions based on real project constraints:
- Microservices architecture chosen to address scalability limitations while preserving desktop functionality
- Hybrid deployment strategy accommodates existing Windows installer expectations
- Legacy adapter pattern ensures zero-disruption migration for existing users

Existing system compatibility requirements with specific verification steps:
- Every new component must include integration verification tests
- Performance impact must be measured against current BERT v2.4.3 benchmarks
- User function execution behavior must remain identical to preserve existing workflows

Clear sequencing of implementation to minimize risk to existing functionality:
1. Establish CI/CD foundation without disrupting current build process
2. Modernize dependencies with compatibility layers before removing legacy versions
3. Implement microservices architecture while maintaining existing interfaces
4. Gradually migrate UI components while preserving existing user workflows
