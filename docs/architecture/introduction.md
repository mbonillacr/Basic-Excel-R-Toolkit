# Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing BERT (Basic Excel R Toolkit) v2.4.3 with comprehensive modernization including cloud-native architecture, updated dependencies, multi-platform support, and enterprise features. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of new features while ensuring seamless integration with the existing system.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document supplements existing BERT v2.4.3 monorepo architecture by defining how new microservices components will integrate with current C++/COM Excel Add-in, TypeScript Console, and language controllers. Where conflicts arise between new cloud-native patterns and existing desktop patterns, this document provides guidance on maintaining backward compatibility while implementing modern enhancements.

## Existing Project Analysis

**Current Project State:**
- **Primary Purpose:** Excel integration connector for R and Julia programming languages with interactive console
- **Current Tech Stack:** C++ (BERT Core/COM), TypeScript (Electron Console), R 3.4.x, Julia 0.6.2, Protocol Buffers 3.5.0, Visual Studio 2017
- **Architecture Style:** Monolithic desktop application with process separation between Excel Add-in and language services
- **Deployment Method:** Windows installer with local process management and file-based configuration

**Available Documentation:**
- README.md with installation and overview information
- package.json defining Console dependencies and build scripts
- Visual Studio solution files (.sln, .vcxproj) for C++ components
- Protocol Buffers schema definitions for IPC communication
- Example R and Julia function files demonstrating usage patterns

**Identified Constraints:**
- Windows-only deployment with Excel COM interface dependencies
- Legacy language versions (R 3.4.x, Julia 0.6.2) with potential breaking changes in modern versions
- File-based configuration storage limiting scalability and collaboration
- Electron 1.8.2 with security vulnerabilities and limited modern features
- No automated testing or CI/CD infrastructure
- Monolithic architecture limiting independent scaling and platform expansion
