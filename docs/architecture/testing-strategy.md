# Testing Strategy

## Integration with Existing Tests
**Existing Test Framework:** Limited unit tests using basic C++ testing, no formal JavaScript testing framework
**Test Organization:** Tests scattered across component directories, no centralized test management
**Coverage Requirements:** No formal coverage requirements, minimal existing test coverage

## New Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests for New Components
- **Framework:** Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript, Google Test for C++, pytest for Python components
- **Location:** `tests/unit/` directory with component-specific subdirectories
- **Coverage Target:** >90% code coverage for all new components
- **Integration with Existing:** Preserve existing test behavior while adding comprehensive coverage

### Integration Tests
- **Scope:** Service-to-service communication, database integration, API endpoint validation
- **Existing System Verification:** All existing function execution paths validated through integration tests
- **New Feature Testing:** End-to-end testing of new collaborative features and multi-platform support

### Regression Testing
- **Existing Feature Verification:** Automated test suite validating all BERT v2.4.3 functionality remains intact
- **Automated Regression Suite:** GitHub Actions workflow running full regression suite on every commit
- **Manual Testing Requirements:** User acceptance testing for UI changes and workflow modifications
