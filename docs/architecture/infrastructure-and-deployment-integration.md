# Infrastructure and Deployment Integration

## Existing Infrastructure
**Current Deployment:** Windows installer (.msi) with local installation and manual updates
**Infrastructure Tools:** Visual Studio build system, manual release process
**Environments:** Single production environment with user-managed installations

## Enhancement Deployment Strategy
**Deployment Approach:** Hybrid deployment - containerized services with traditional desktop installer for Excel Add-in
**Infrastructure Changes:** Docker containers for services, Kubernetes for orchestration, GitHub Actions for CI/CD
**Pipeline Integration:** Automated builds, testing, and deployment with blue-green strategy for services

## Rollback Strategy
**Rollback Method:** Service-level rollback using Kubernetes deployments, desktop component rollback through installer versioning
**Risk Mitigation:** Feature flags for gradual rollout, comprehensive monitoring and alerting
**Monitoring:** Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, ELK stack for logging
