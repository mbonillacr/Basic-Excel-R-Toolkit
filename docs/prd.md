# BERT v3.0 Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Analysis Source
**IDE-based fresh analysis** - Comprehensive analysis of existing BERT v2.4.3 codebase and architecture performed using BMad Master Checklist validation.

- Excel Add-in (C++/COM) for function execution
- Console interface (TypeScript/Electron) for interactive development
- Language controllers for R and Julia process management
- Protocol Buffers-based IPC for cross-process communication
- Monorepo architecture with Visual Studio solution

**Critical Finding**: System has 23 critical deficiencies identified in PO Master Checklist, requiring comprehensive modernization approach.

**Impact Assessment:**
- ✅ Major Impact (architectural changes required)

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
- Modernize technology stack (R 4.3+, Julia 1.9+, Electron 28+, Protocol Buffers v4)
- Implement cloud-native microservices architecture
- Add multi-platform support (Excel Online, Google Sheets)
- Establish enterprise security and governance features
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility with BERT v2.x
- Implement comprehensive CI/CD and testing infrastructure

**Background Context:**
BERT v2.4.3 suffers from critical technical debt with obsolete dependencies (Julia 0.6.2, R 3.4.x, Electron 1.8.2) and lacks modern DevOps practices. The monolithic architecture limits scalability and platform expansion. Enterprise adoption requires security, governance, and collaboration features currently missing. This enhancement addresses these limitations while preserving the core value proposition of seamless Excel-to-programming-language integration.
