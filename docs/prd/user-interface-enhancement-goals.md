# User Interface Enhancement Goals

## Integration with Existing UI
New UI components will extend the existing Electron-based Console while maintaining familiar workflows. Modern React components will be integrated alongside existing TypeScript modules using micro-frontend architecture to ensure seamless user experience.

## Modified/New Screens and Views
- **Enhanced Console**: Modern Monaco editor with AI assistance
- **Workspace Manager**: New collaborative workspace interface
- **Plugin Marketplace**: New plugin discovery and management interface
- **Admin Dashboard**: New enterprise administration interface
- **Multi-Platform Clients**: New web-based clients for Excel Online/Google Sheets

## UI Consistency Requirements
All new interfaces must follow existing BERT design language with consistent color schemes, typography, and interaction patterns. Legacy Console shortcuts and workflows must remain functional.
