# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** BERT v3.0 shall maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing BERT v2.x Excel workbooks and user-defined functions without requiring user migration.

**FR2:** The system shall support modern language versions (R 4.3+, Julia 1.9+) while maintaining legacy version compatibility through containerized services.

**FR3:** BERT v3.0 shall provide multi-platform support including Excel Desktop, Excel Online, and Google Sheets through unified API gateway.

**FR4:** The system shall implement microservices architecture with independent language services (R, Julia, Python) deployable as Docker containers.

**FR5:** BERT v3.0 shall provide enterprise authentication through SSO integration (Azure AD, SAML) with role-based access control.

**FR6:** The system shall support collaborative workspaces with real-time function sharing and version control integration.

**FR7:** BERT v3.0 shall implement AI-assisted code generation and natural language query capabilities.

**FR8:** The system shall provide comprehensive plugin architecture supporting custom language integrations.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** System response time shall not exceed 100ms for simple function execution, maintaining current BERT v2.x performance characteristics.

**NFR2:** The architecture shall support horizontal scaling to 1000+ concurrent users with 99.9% uptime SLA.

**NFR3:** All data transmission shall be encrypted using TLS 1.3 with enterprise-grade security compliance (SOX, GDPR).

**NFR4:** The system shall implement comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting using industry-standard tools (Prometheus, Grafana).

**NFR5:** Memory usage shall not exceed current BERT v2.x baseline by more than 20% for equivalent functionality.

**NFR6:** The system shall support zero-downtime deployments with automated rollback capabilities.

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1:** API compatibility with existing Excel VBA integration must be maintained through legacy adapter layer.

**CR2:** Database schema compatibility for user functions and configurations must be preserved with automated migration path.

**CR3:** UI/UX consistency with existing Console interface must be maintained while adding modern features.

**CR4:** Integration compatibility with existing R packages and Julia modules must be preserved through version management.
