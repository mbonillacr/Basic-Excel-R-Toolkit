# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack
**Languages**: C++ (BERT Core), TypeScript (Console), R, Julia
**Frameworks**: Electron 1.8.2, Visual Studio 2017, Protocol Buffers 3.5.0
**Database**: File-based configuration storage
**Infrastructure**: Windows-only deployment, local process management
**External Dependencies**: Excel SDK, R 3.4.x, Julia 0.6.2, Node.js

## Integration Approach
**Database Integration Strategy**: Migrate from file-based to PostgreSQL with automated migration scripts preserving existing configurations.

**API Integration Strategy**: Implement API Gateway (Express.js) with backward-compatible endpoints wrapping new microservices while maintaining existing COM interfaces.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Micro-frontend architecture allowing gradual migration from existing Electron app to modern React components.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Comprehensive test suite covering existing functionality regression, new feature validation, and integration testing across all platforms.

## Code Organization and Standards
**File Structure Approach**: Maintain existing monorepo structure while adding new microservices directories with clear separation of concerns.

**Naming Conventions**: Preserve existing C++ and TypeScript conventions while establishing new standards for microservices (kebab-case for services, PascalCase for components).

**Coding Standards**: Implement ESLint, Prettier, and C++ static analysis tools with gradual enforcement on existing codebase.

**Documentation Standards**: Comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI 3.0, inline code documentation, and architectural decision records (ADRs).

## Deployment and Operations
**Build Process Integration**: Migrate from Visual Studio solution to modern CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions with Docker containerization.

**Deployment Strategy**: Blue-green deployment for services with feature flags for gradual rollout, maintaining existing installer for desktop components.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Implement centralized logging (ELK stack) and monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana) with existing system health preservation.

**Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration management with secure secret handling replacing current file-based approach.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation
**Technical Risks**: 
- Dependency upgrade breaking changes (R/Julia API changes)
- COM interface compatibility issues with Excel versions
- Performance degradation during migration

**Integration Risks**:
- Existing user functions breaking during language version upgrades
- Excel Add-in registration issues across Windows versions
- Data migration corruption risks

**Deployment Risks**:
- User environment compatibility issues
- Network connectivity requirements for cloud features
- Rollback complexity for hybrid architecture

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive regression testing suite
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Automated rollback procedures
- Extensive user acceptance testing
- Parallel deployment capability
