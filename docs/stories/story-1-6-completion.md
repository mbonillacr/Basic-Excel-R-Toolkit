# Story 1.6 Implementation Complete: AI-Assisted Development Features

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented AI-powered code generation and intelligent assistance features for BERT v3.0, enabling natural language to code conversion and smart development assistance.

## Completed Components

### 1. AI Service (`services/ai-service/`)
- Natural language to R/Julia code generation
- Intelligent code completion suggestions
- Error explanation and debugging assistance
- Function documentation auto-generation
- Rate limiting and cost management
- Fallback templates for offline operation

### 2. AI Integration Features
