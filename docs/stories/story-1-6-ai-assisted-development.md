# Story 1.6: AI-Assisted Development Features Implementation

## Story Overview
**As a Data Analyst**, I want AI-powered code generation and natural language query capabilities, so that I can create complex functions more efficiently with intelligent assistance.

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Natural Language to Code Generation
- Integrate OpenAI/Azure OpenAI APIs for code generation
- Implement R and Julia code generation from natural language
- Add context-aware suggestions based on available data
- Create code validation and syntax checking

### Task 2: Intelligent Code Completion
- Implement Monaco Editor with AI-powered IntelliSense
- Add function signature suggestions
- Create smart variable and package recommendations
- Implement code pattern recognition

### Task 3: Documentation and Error Assistance
- Auto-generate function documentation from code analysis
- Implement intelligent error explanation system
- Add debugging assistance with suggested fixes
- Create code optimization recommendations

### Task 4: AI Service Integration
- Create AI service microservice for centralized AI operations
- Implement rate limiting and cost management
- Add model selection and configuration options
- Create fallback mechanisms for offline operation

## Acceptance Criteria Validation
✅ Natural language to R/Julia code generation integrated in Console
✅ Intelligent code completion using context-aware suggestions
✅ Function documentation auto-generation from code analysis
✅ Error explanation and debugging assistance
✅ Integration with popular AI services (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI)

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing manual coding workflows remain fully functional
- IV2: AI features operate as optional enhancements without disrupting current usage
- IV3: Code generation quality meets accuracy thresholds (>85% syntactically correct)

## Implementation Status: READY FOR DEVELOPMENT
