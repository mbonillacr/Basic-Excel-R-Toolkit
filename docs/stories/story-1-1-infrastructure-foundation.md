# Story 1.1: Infrastructure Foundation and CI/CD Pipeline

**Epic**: BERT v3.0 Modernization and Cloud-Native Migration  
**Story ID**: 1.1  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Effort**: 5 days  

## User Story

As a **DevOps Engineer**,  
I want **to establish modern CI/CD pipeline and containerization infrastructure**,  
so that **BERT v3.0 can be built, tested, and deployed reliably with automated quality gates**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **GitHub Actions Pipeline**: Complete CI/CD pipeline that builds all components (C++, TypeScript, Docker images)
2. **Automated Testing**: Testing suite runs on every commit with quality gates and failure notifications
3. **Docker Containerization**: All services containerized with multi-stage builds for optimization
4. **Semantic Versioning**: Automated release management with semantic versioning
5. **Security Scanning**: SAST and dependency scanning integrated into pipeline

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Existing BERT v2.4.3 build process remains functional during transition
- **IV2**: All existing unit tests pass in new pipeline environment
- **IV3**: Performance benchmarks match or exceed current build times

## Technical Implementation Tasks

### Task 1.1.1: GitHub Actions Workflow Setup
- Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for main CI pipeline
- Configure build matrix for multiple platforms (Windows x64, x86)
- Set up artifact storage and caching for build optimization
- Configure branch protection rules requiring CI success

### Task 1.1.2: C++ Build Integration
- Migrate Visual Studio solution build to GitHub Actions
- Configure MSBuild with proper SDK versions
- Set up vcpkg for C++ dependency management
- Ensure COM registration compatibility

### Task 1.1.3: TypeScript/Electron Build Integration
- Configure Node.js build environment (v18+)
- Set up Electron build process with electron-builder
- Configure TypeScript compilation with proper target settings
- Integrate Less compilation for styling

### Task 1.1.4: Docker Infrastructure
- Create Dockerfiles for each microservice (API Gateway, R Service, Julia Service)
- Implement multi-stage builds for size optimization
- Set up Docker Compose for local development
- Configure container registry integration

### Task 1.1.5: Testing Infrastructure
- Integrate existing C++ tests into pipeline
- Set up Jest for TypeScript testing
- Configure test coverage reporting
- Implement test result aggregation and reporting

### Task 1.1.6: Security and Quality Gates
- Integrate CodeQL for SAST scanning
- Set up dependency vulnerability scanning
- Configure SonarCloud for code quality analysis
- Implement security policy enforcement

### Task 1.1.7: Release Automation
- Configure semantic-release for automated versioning
- Set up release notes generation
- Implement artifact publishing to GitHub Releases
- Configure deployment triggers for different environments

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All existing BERT v2.4.3 components build successfully in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Pipeline completes in <15 minutes for full build
- [ ] All security scans pass with zero critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Automated tests achieve >80% code coverage
- [ ] Release artifacts are automatically generated and published
- [ ] Documentation updated with new build procedures
- [ ] Team trained on new CI/CD processes

## Dependencies

- **Upstream**: None (foundational story)
- **Downstream**: All subsequent stories depend on this infrastructure

## Risks and Mitigation

**Risk**: Existing build process disruption  
**Mitigation**: Maintain parallel build systems during transition

**Risk**: Performance degradation in build times  
**Mitigation**: Implement aggressive caching and parallel builds

**Risk**: Security scanning false positives  
**Mitigation**: Configure appropriate exclusions and thresholds
