# Story 1.4: Multi-Platform Client Development

**Epic**: BERT v3.0 Modernization and Cloud-Native Migration  
**Story ID**: 1.4  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 10 days  

## Previous Story Notes Review

**Story 1.3 Completion**: Microservices architecture operational
- ✅ API Gateway with REST/gRPC routing functional
- ✅ R and Julia services with gRPC interfaces ready
- ✅ Service discovery and health checking implemented
- **Key Insight**: REST endpoints ready for web client integration

## User Story

As a **Frontend Developer**,  
I want **to create web-based clients for Excel Online and Google Sheets**,  
so that **BERT functionality extends beyond Windows desktop environments**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Excel Online Add-in**: Developed using Office.js framework with full function execution
2. **Google Sheets Add-on**: Created with Apps Script integration and BERT API connectivity
3. **Web Console (PWA)**: Feature parity with desktop Console, offline capability
4. **Unified Authentication**: Single sign-on across all platform clients
5. **Function Synchronization**: Seamless function sharing between desktop and web clients

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Desktop Excel Add-in functionality unaffected by web client development
- **IV2**: Existing user functions accessible from all platform clients
- **IV3**: Performance parity maintained across platform implementations

## Technical Implementation Tasks

### Task 1.4.1: Excel Online Add-in Development
- Create Office.js manifest and configuration
- Implement task pane UI with React components
- Integrate with BERT API Gateway for function execution
- Handle Excel Online API limitations and workarounds

### Task 1.4.2: Google Sheets Add-on Development
- Create Apps Script project with HTML service UI
- Implement Google Sheets API integration
