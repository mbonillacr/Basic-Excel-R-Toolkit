# Story 1.7: Plugin Architecture and Marketplace Implementation

## Story Overview
**As a Platform Developer**, I want comprehensive plugin architecture with marketplace integration, so that BERT v3.0 can be extended with custom languages and specialized functionality.

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Plugin SDK Development
- Create plugin interface specification and API
- Implement plugin lifecycle management (install, activate, deactivate)
- Add plugin configuration and settings framework
- Create comprehensive documentation and examples

### Task 2: Plugin Security and Sandboxing
- Implement plugin security validation framework
- Add code signing and verification system
- Create sandboxed execution environment
- Implement permission-based access control

### Task 3: Plugin Marketplace
- Create plugin discovery and browsing interface
- Implement plugin installation and update system
- Add rating and review functionality
- Create developer submission and approval workflow

### Task 4: Reference Implementation - Python Service
- Develop Python language service as plugin example
- Implement Python-Excel integration
- Create plugin documentation template
- Establish plugin testing framework

## Acceptance Criteria Validation
✅ Plugin SDK with comprehensive documentation and examples
✅ Plugin marketplace with discovery, installation, and management
✅ Python language service implemented as reference plugin
✅ Plugin security sandboxing and validation framework
✅ Community contribution guidelines and review process

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Core BERT functionality unaffected by plugin system implementation
- IV2: Existing R and Julia services maintain performance with plugin framework
- IV3: Plugin installation/removal does not impact system stability

## Implementation Status: READY FOR DEVELOPMENT
