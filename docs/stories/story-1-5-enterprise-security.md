# Story 1.5: Enterprise Security and Governance Implementation

## Story Overview
**As a Security Administrator**, I want to implement enterprise-grade security and governance features, so that BERT v3.0 meets organizational compliance and security requirements.

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: SSO Integration and Authentication
- Implement Azure AD integration using MSAL.js
- Add SAML 2.0 support for enterprise identity providers
- Create role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Implement JWT token management and refresh

### Task 2: Data Encryption and Security
- Implement TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- Add data encryption at rest using AES-256
- Implement secure key management with Azure Key Vault
- Add certificate management for service-to-service communication

### Task 3: Audit Logging and Compliance
- Implement comprehensive audit logging for all function executions
- Add compliance reporting for SOX and GDPR requirements
- Create audit trail for data access and modifications
- Implement log retention and archival policies

### Task 4: Admin Dashboard
- Create admin interface for user management
- Implement function governance and approval workflows
- Add security monitoring and alerting
- Create compliance reporting dashboard

## Acceptance Criteria Validation
✅ SSO integration (Azure AD, SAML) with role-based access control
✅ Function execution auditing and compliance logging
✅ Data encryption at rest and in transit (TLS 1.3)
✅ Admin dashboard for user and function management
✅ Compliance reporting (SOX, GDPR) capabilities

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing single-user functionality preserved for non-enterprise deployments
- IV2: Current function execution behavior maintained under new security model
- IV3: Performance impact of security features minimized (<10% overhead)

## Implementation Status: READY FOR DEVELOPMENT
