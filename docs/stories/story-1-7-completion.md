# Story 1.7 Implementation Complete: Plugin Architecture and Marketplace

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive plugin architecture with marketplace integration, enabling BERT v3.0 extensibility through custom language services and specialized functionality.

## Completed Components

### 1. Plugin Manager Service (`services/plugin-manager/`)
- Plugin lifecycle management (install, activate, deactivate)
- Security validation and sandboxing framework
- Plugin registry with metadata management
- Marketplace integration with plugin discovery
- Permission-based access control system

### 2. Python Service Reference Plugin (`services/python-service/`)
- Complete Python language service implementation
- Excel data integration with pandas/numpy
- Data analysis helper functions
- Security-constrained execution environment
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 3. Plugin Architecture Features
- Plugin SDK with manifest validation
- Security scanning for dangerous permissions
- Plugin marketplace with ratings and reviews
- Developer submission and approval workflow
- Community contribution guidelines

## Integration Verification Results
✅ **IV1**: Core BERT functionality unaffected - plugin system operates independently
✅ **IV2**: R and Julia services maintain performance - no impact on existing services
✅ **IV3**: System stability preserved - plugin isolation prevents crashes

## Plugin System Features
- Secure plugin installation and management
- Permission-based security model
- Plugin marketplace with 3 example plugins
- Python service as fully functional reference implementation
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Plugin versioning and dependency management

## Security Features
- Code signing and verification framework
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Permission validation (file_system_write, network_unrestricted, system_exec)
- Security warnings for dangerous permissions
- Plugin isolation to prevent system compromise

## Next Story Ready
Story 1.9: Migration Tools and User Onboarding can now proceed with complete plugin architecture available.
