# Story 1.9: Migration Tools and User Onboarding Implementation

## Story Overview
**As a BERT Administrator**, I want automated migration tools and comprehensive user onboarding, so that existing BERT v2.x users can seamlessly transition to v3.0 without data loss.

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Automated Migration Utility
- Create configuration migration from BERT v2.x to v3.0
- Implement user function preservation and validation
- Add database schema migration for new features
- Create backup and rollback mechanisms

### Task 2: Side-by-Side Installation
- Enable parallel BERT v2.x and v3.0 installation
- Implement version detection and switching
- Add configuration isolation between versions
- Create gradual migration workflow

### Task 3: User Onboarding System
- Create interactive setup wizard for new installations
- Implement guided tour of new v3.0 features
- Add comprehensive documentation and tutorials
- Create video tutorial integration

### Task 4: Feedback and Support System
- Implement user feedback collection mechanism
- Add issue tracking and reporting system
- Create support ticket integration
- Implement usage analytics for improvement insights

## Acceptance Criteria Validation
✅ Automated migration utility for user configurations and functions
✅ Side-by-side installation capability for gradual transition
✅ Comprehensive migration documentation and video tutorials
✅ User feedback collection and issue tracking system
✅ Rollback capability to BERT v2.x if needed

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Migration preserves 100% of existing user functions and configurations
- IV2: Migrated functions execute identically to original BERT v2.x behavior
- IV3: Migration process completes without user data corruption or loss

## Implementation Status: READY FOR DEVELOPMENT
