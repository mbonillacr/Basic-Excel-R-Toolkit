# Story 1.10: Production Deployment and Monitoring Implementation

## Story Overview
**As an Operations Engineer**, I want production-ready deployment with comprehensive monitoring and alerting, so that BERT v3.0 operates reliably in enterprise environments with proactive issue detection.

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Production Deployment Automation
- Implement blue-green deployment strategy with Docker Swarm/Kubernetes
- Create automated deployment scripts with rollback capability
- Add environment-specific configuration management
- Implement zero-downtime deployment procedures

### Task 2: Monitoring and Observability
- Deploy Prometheus for metrics collection
- Configure Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Implement distributed tracing with Jaeger
- Add custom metrics for BERT-specific operations

### Task 3: Logging and Alerting
- Deploy ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Configure centralized log aggregation
- Implement intelligent alerting with PagerDuty/Slack
- Add log analysis and anomaly detection

### Task 4: Disaster Recovery and Backup
- Implement automated backup strategies
- Create disaster recovery procedures
- Add data replication and failover mechanisms
- Establish recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO)

## Acceptance Criteria Validation
✅ Production deployment automation with blue-green deployment strategy
✅ Comprehensive monitoring dashboard (Grafana) with key performance indicators
✅ Automated alerting for system health, performance, and security issues
✅ Log aggregation and analysis (ELK stack) for troubleshooting
✅ Disaster recovery procedures and backup strategies

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Deployment process maintains existing system availability during updates
- IV2: Monitoring captures all critical metrics without performance impact
- IV3: Alerting system accurately identifies issues without false positives

## Implementation Status: READY FOR DEVELOPMENT
