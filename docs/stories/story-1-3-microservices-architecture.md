# Story 1.3: Microservices Architecture Implementation

**Epic**: BERT v3.0 Modernization and Cloud-Native Migration  
**Story ID**: 1.3  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Effort**: 8 days  

## Previous Story Notes Review

**Story 1.2 Completion**: Dependency modernization successful
- ✅ R 4.3+ and Julia 1.9+ with compatibility layers operational
- ✅ Electron 28+ Console upgrade preserves existing functionality
- ✅ Protocol Buffers v4 with v3 compatibility implemented
- **Key Insight**: Container infrastructure ready for microservices deployment

## User Story

As a **System Architect**,  
I want **to decompose monolithic architecture into containerized microservices**,  
so that **BERT v3.0 can scale independently and support multiple platforms**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **R Service**: Containerized with REST API and gRPC interfaces
2. **Julia Service**: Containerized with independent lifecycle management
3. **API Gateway**: Implemented with request routing and load balancing
4. **Service Discovery**: Health checking and service registration implemented
5. **Legacy Adapter**: Existing COM interface preserved through adapter layer

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Excel Add-in continues to function with existing user workbooks
- **IV2**: Console maintains connection to language services without user impact
- **IV3**: Function execution latency remains within acceptable bounds (<150ms)

## Technical Implementation Tasks

### Task 1.3.1: API Gateway Service Implementation
- Create Express.js API Gateway with routing and load balancing
- Implement authentication and authorization middleware
- Set up service discovery and health checking
- Configure rate limiting and request validation

### Task 1.3.2: R Language Service Implementation
- Implement gRPC server for R function execution
- Create REST API endpoints for web client integration
- Set up R environment management and isolation
- Implement function registry and metadata management

### Task 1.3.3: Julia Language Service Implementation
- Implement gRPC server for Julia function execution
- Create REST API endpoints for web client integration
- Set up Julia environment management and isolation
- Implement function registry and metadata management

### Task 1.3.4: Legacy Adapter Service Implementation
- Create COM interface compatibility layer
- Implement gRPC client for communication with new services
- Maintain Protocol Buffers v3 compatibility
- Ensure zero-disruption migration for existing Excel Add-in

### Task 1.3.5: Service Orchestration and Deployment
- Configure Docker Compose for local development
- Set up service networking and communication
- Implement monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Create deployment scripts and health checks

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All microservices operational with independent scaling
- [ ] API Gateway routes requests correctly to language services
- [ ] Legacy COM interface maintains 100% compatibility
- [ ] Function execution performance meets latency requirements
- [ ] Service health monitoring and alerting functional
- [ ] Integration tests validate cross-service communication
- [ ] Documentation updated with new architecture
